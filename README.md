# Case Management Tool (Frontend)

A responsive web-based **case management interface** built with **Next.js and Tailwind CSS** to streamline workflows and enhance accessibility for clients and staff.  
This project integrates seamlessly with the backend API and supports Microsoft 365 features such as calendar events and task synchronization.
